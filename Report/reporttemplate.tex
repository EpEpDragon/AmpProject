\section{Circuit Diagram}
\textbf{This section counts for 1 mark.}

This section should contain a complete circuit diagram for your design (both preamplifier and power amplifier stages must be included). Label the components in the diagram so that you can easily refer to them throughout the rest of the report.

\section{Power Amplifier Design}
\textbf{This section counts for 2 marks.}

This section should include a detailed description of the entire design process for the power amplifier stage. All equations should be included. All design decisions should be substantiated. Discuss any fine-tuning to theoretical values that may have been performed as a result of initial simulations.

This section should include a detailed description of the entire design process for the preamplifier stage. All equations should be included. All design decisions should be substantiated. Discuss any fine-tuning to theoretical values that may have been performed as a result of initial simulations.

\section{Frequency Analysis and Capacitor Design}
\textbf{This section counts for 1 mark.}

This section should include a description of the steps taken to perform a frequency analysis and choose the capacitor values in your design. (i.e. choice of capacitor for dominant pole, frequencies designed for, equations used, etc.). Also discuss any fine-tuning to theoretical capacitor values that may have been performed as a result of initial simulations.

\section{Power and Thermal Analysis}
\textbf{This section counts for 2 marks -- 1 for power analysis and any relevant discussion and 1 for thermal analysis and any relevant discussion.}

This section should include a list of the power dissipated in every component of the amplifier system. Detail the equations used to calculate power dissipation in the transistors and to perform a thermal analysis (example shown below). Include a discussion of steps taken (if any) to account for high power dissipation in specific components or an unsatisfactory thermal response for transistors.


\begin{equation} \label{eqn:pwr}
  P_{Q1} = V_{CE}I_{C} = 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:temp1}
  T_{j1} = \left(\theta_{jc}+\theta_{ca}\right)P_{Q1} = 
\end{equation}

\section{Results and Conclusions}
\textbf{This section counts for 2 marks.}

This section should include a discussion of the results obtained using the SPICE test bench with your design and the measurements of the physical circuit. Shortfalls and potential improvements to your design should be included here.
